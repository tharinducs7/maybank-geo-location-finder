# GeoLocation App 

## Available Scripts

First you need to install node modules by running:

### `yarn`

You need to have GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY inorder to run this application. 

I have added .example.env file
Rename it to .env and replace your google api key.


In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
